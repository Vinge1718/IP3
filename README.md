## Arrays and Loops

## Project Purpose

A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

1. Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
2. Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
3. Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

## Set up
The program can be found [here](https://vinge1718.github.io/IP3/)

## Known Problems
- When applying the 'for-if' logic loop, the output overwrites the DOM
- Global declaration/innititalisation of the *name* **userNumber** as the _input field_ doesn't work. One has to do it locally at the **click event**.

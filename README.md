## Project Purpose

A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

1. Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
2. Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
3. Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

A Link to another page with a simple humidity checker where:

* You will have to sign up for a free account at the [Open Weather Map site](http://openweathermap.org/) where you will be provided with an API key that you can use to access their data after making an AJAX request
* Create a '.env' file inn the parent directory where you will paste the API key as a string assigned the the variable 'exports.apiKey ' for example `exports.apiKey = api-key-provided`.
